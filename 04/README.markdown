# Week 4

## Weather

I have solved this in one in Python, see [weather.py](weather.py).

As one can see from the p-values, the quadratic fit is the best one:

| Degree | χ² | χ² / dof | p |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1.5e+03 | 11 | 0 |
| 1 | 3.9e+02 | 2.9 | 0 |
| 2 | 2.1e+02 | 1.6 | 8.6e-06 |
| 3 | 2.1e+02 | 1.6 | 2.5e-05 |
